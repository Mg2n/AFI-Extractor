# AFI-Extractor (Automation Script)

üìÑ This is a **Python automation script** that extracts AFIs (Areas for Improvement) from **Word (.docx)** and **PDF** reports, then writes them into a single **Excel file**.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:**  
This is **not a general-purpose project**.  
The script is designed for one specific use case: parsing reports where AFIs, Classifications, Entities, Recommendations, and Processes follow a fixed format.  
It will not work correctly on arbitrary documents.

  - **EE/FA (Process name/number)** from headings like:
    - `Process 1.1 Something`
    - or `Value / Operational / Business`
